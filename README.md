Recipics in an under construction Android application for digitizing paper recipes. With Recipics you take a picture of your recipe and add some meta information, like tags (eg. "vegetarian" or "dessert"), notes information (eg. "used only 1.5dl flour") or source, considering that particular recipe. Recipics forms a database of your precious recipes that you can search using keywords or the tags, instead of going through numerous cookbooks and cooking magazines to find what you want.

Functionalities to be added:
* Search recipes based on search words and tags
* Recipe sharing
* Cooking mode: View only the picture(s)
* Add several pictures of one recipe to allow complicated, several page or otherwise big recipes to be saved
* An awesome UI
* Back up
